# (WIP) Bamboo HR plugin for Mattermost

Bamboo HR is a software platform for companies to manage their human resources (HR).

For a company that has chosen to use both Mattermost and Bamboo HR, this plugin would aim to integrate the two. The plugin would provide users (from Mattermost) with important information about employees in the company. Without leaving Mattermost, a user can view HR information, see new people who joined, employees who have left, etc.

The idea is to either provide a bot or a button in the channel header where users could click and get this information in the modal. The idea is not yet fully formed :)

Contributions are welcome!
